# serviceworkerapi

## Description

https://serviceworker-api.firebaseapp.com/ is service worker background sync powered dashboard.

Can be used to create fast and flexible dashboard, that contains any information that can be reached through clients browser. However project had major set back due https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SyncManager being set off the standardisation track, and not being supported by any major browser.

So at the moment data can only be collected while web page is actually open and active.
